<h1>To-Do App</h1>

A project from the Bloc Design Apprenticeship

**To-Do App** is a simple application written in:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

The app allows users to input text to add items to a to do list.
Users can then check off items that have been done and delete items from their list.

The app uses styling from **Material Design Light**.
